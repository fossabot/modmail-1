# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As Modmail is currently under active development with no official releases,
the current dev state is supported security wise. Please do not remain on old
versions long, as that may make contributing difficult.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| <  1.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| >= 1.0  | Unreleased         |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7jBUXdxw). If it is a sensitive issue,
contact one of the @devs privately so we can ensure it remains private until it has been appropriately fixed.
